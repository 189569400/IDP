The core features of IDP are as follows:
* Mixed language support: deeply support Python, SQL and Markdown language in the same notebook.
* Data visualization: generating data insights directly using in-built data visualization tools, e.g.,bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, etc..
* Automatic versioning: automatic tracking and managing of code changes; clear and convenient version comparison. 
* Coding assistance: powerful coding assistance functions including intelligent code completion, hovor, diagnostic and quickfix.
* Package manager: search and manage python packages easily and efficiently.
* Variable manager: interactively browse and manage variables and conveniently compare different algorithm approaches and parameter settings.
* Managing environment: conveniently cloning a Python/system environment for reuse to avoid tedious repeated configuration.
